# FarmCart

## Overview

FarmCart is an online marketplace that enables farmers to sell their products directly to consumers. By eliminating the middleman, FarmCart ensures fresh produce is accessible at competitive prices and facilitates faster transactions. The platform features a smooth, user-friendly interface that enhances the buying experience.

## Technology Stack

- **Hibernate**: Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool for seamless interaction between Java objects and the MySQL database. It simplifies database operations and efficiently manages user and product data storage.
  
- **Spring Boot**: The backbone of the application, responsible for managing server processes and backend logic. Spring Boot handles authentication, product listings, and transaction processing.
  
- **MySQL**: The database system used to store critical data, including user profiles, product information, orders, and transactions. Hibernate ORM ensures efficient data storage and retrieval.
  
- **React**: Manages the user interface, providing a dynamic and responsive frontend. It handles page rendering for product listings, user profiles, and order summaries, ensuring a seamless experience.
  
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework used to style the user interface, allowing for visually appealing and easy-to-navigate designs that are responsive across devices.
  
- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js. It manages communication between the frontend (React components) and backend (Spring Boot services) by sending HTTP requests to fetch or post data.

- **View Product Details**: Access detailed information about each product, including descriptions and prices.
